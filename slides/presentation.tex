Inputs for each BTS :
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pe : Emission power
  \item Ge : Emission gain
  \item F : Frequency
  \item HO\_MARGIN : Minimum marge between two signals to allow handover ;
  \item MS\_TXPWR\_MAX : Maximum emission power allowed to be used by the MS in a cell.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item BTS\_TXPWR\_MAX : Maximum emission power allowed to be used by the BTS in a cell.
  \item RXLEV\_MIN : Electromagnetic field level to access to a cell.
  \item MAX\_MS\_RANGE : Maximum distance between Mobile Station and BTS.
  \item L\_RXQUAL\_H: Minimum quality to allow handover.
  \item L\_RXLEV\_DL\_H : Minimum received level to allow handover on downlink.
  \item L\_RXLEV\_UP\_H : Minimum received level to allow handover on uplink.

\section{Handover algorithm}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Handover algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Measure phase : RxLev uplink and downlink, RxQual uplink and downlink, Distances between MS and BTS each 40ms
  \item Mean phase on 12 samples each 480ms
  \item Storing between 8 and 12 means
  \item Construct neighbour list, looking measures of other cells
  \item For each cell of the neighbour list, decide if handover is possible.
  \item If handover is possible, the order to change of bts must be repeated 3
times.
