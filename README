========== Install ==========

No installation is required, only python interpreter and PyQt4 library.

========== Usage ==========

Simply run src/enrover.py, open a map file and look for MS doing handover
between BTS. You can specify extra parameter to open directly a map and set
MS speed.

src/enrover.py [file [speed]]
file is an xml file and speed must be less than 5.

========== Logging ==========

Measures and handover decision are logged in a file named with date and hour put
in log/ directory.
